## TaskGeneration
python code to generate tasks:

- tasks.py generates tasks with random power (uniform law) and random
  processing times (exponential law) 
- fietelsohnTasks.py tasks with random power (uniform law) and random
  processing times (hypergama law from Fietelsohn's paper) 

## IntervalsGeneration
python code to generate intervals:

- interval.py generates intervals with a bell shape
- interFromTasks.py takes a set of tasks and generate a set of
  interavls that exactly matches the tasks
